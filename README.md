# This is the MovieSearch!
This is nothing more than an IMDb-based movie search view made with Reactjs.
I assume you want to see what I've done so far. To view the project just follow these steps: 

### 1º Step: Clone the GitHub repo
Choose the folder you like the most and type into the terminal: 
```
git clone https://github.com/JeanMichaelC/MovieSearch.git
```
### 2º Step: Install your dependencies
Make sure that npm has installed all the required packages for the project:
```
npm install
```
### 3º Step: Mount your  dev-server in seconds!
You only need to type this in the project's folder terminal: 
```
npm run dev
```
Remember that you will see the proyect in the localhost:9000

## And that's all!
I hope you like it 👋
